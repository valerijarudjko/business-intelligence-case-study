# Business Intelligence Case Study

This project analyses Tenflix, a fictional streaming company that evolved from a traditional DVD rental business into a global online entertainment platform. It explores how Business Intelligence (BI) techniques are applied to manage and interpret vast amounts of user and content data in real time. The study examines how BI enables personalised recommendations, data-driven decision-making, and strategic forecasting, distinguishing it from traditional manual data analysis. Objectives include understanding BIâ€™s role in enhancing customer experience, improving operational efficiency, and supporting sustainable business growth. Overall, the project highlights how data intelligence transforms modern digital enterprises into adaptive, customer-focused organisations.

## Tenflix: Background

Two young entrepreneurs invested the little capital they had to open a DVD rental store back in 1990. They rented a small shop in their town, The Dogs, in Santa Clara County, California. Everything was perfect, and the business started to grow so much that they soon realized they needed a larger space and began opening stores in other locations.
 
In the late 90s, a significant new phenomenon called the Internet emerged. It became very popular and started to gain many followers, and it was very affordable for users. Quickly, the Internet entered everyone's lives, and users shared all kinds of resources easily, quickly, and cheaply, from messages to games to movies. This did not sit well with our entrepreneurs, who were no longer so young. They saw how, in a very short time, the entire business they had built with great effort and dedication was falling apart. People stopped renting DVDs because they had them on the Internet, in lower quality with interruptions, but very cheaply or almost free.
 
They saw even the big companies stop producing those formats, and all the small businesses that did the same thing as them closed down.
 
So, they had to make a decision. They decided that the giant of the Internet, which had ended their dreams, would become their ally. They saw the great opportunity to continue marketing their products, but not just nationally, but globally without limits, as the new era promised.
 
So they created a company called Tenflix, so that people could continue watching their favorite movies, series, and documentaries in great quality without leaving their homes. Additionally, it allowed viewing of these movies on any mobile device.
 
The high potential customer base they could access made the user fees very affordable, and the improvement in the quality of the Internet and, above all, the speed and capacity of the servers allowed them to host large amounts of titles in an enormous catalog. This practically covered the needs of any user. Thus, their business grew until it reached $29.7 billion in 2021, 25 years since its founding.
 
The large volume of movies in their catalog and the millions of users worldwide allowed the company to gather an enormous amount of data that is cross-referenced and arrives in real-time to the company's servers.

## To do:

1. Question:
 
Since its inception, Tenflix anticipated the possibility of dealing with millions of constantly crossing data. They decided to apply Business Intelligence (BI) techniques to their business model. If they were dealing with millions of data, why did they choose to use BI instead of Big Data?

2. Question:

Why does a different list of movies appear in my session compared to another user's session if I'm a Tenflix platform user?

3. Question:

Recently, the company added a new service that offers users the option to let the platform choose a movie for them when they can't decide. Is the movie they offer really a surprise? Is it something random?

4. Question:

When these young entrepreneurs had their DVD store, they reported monthly on the DVDs rented, which customers rented the most movies, which movies were the most requested, and they could make promotions and offers for the following month or foresee higher stock of movies of a certain genre. On a larger scale, this is still done with BI techniques. Besides the volume of data analyzed, what differentiates or improves BI techniques from what they did manually?

5. Question:

What advantages can BI techniques bring to the business model?
